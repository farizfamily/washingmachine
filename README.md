# washingmachine
this code is to replace electronic board of front loading washing machine, specially they that come with universal motor, not the BLDC 

when you have front loading washing machine, and the electronic module broken
and you dont want to replace them with the original one for what ever reason, then you have 3 option
- but the clone version, which is usually much cheaper and no need any modification, just plug and play
- but the universal controller, this is also available on the market, but you need to modify the wiring, you need to cut you wiring here and there to make it works, and you need also know the basic electrical and electronical
- and the last one is also the fun one, you build everything by your self

not like ac motor fan, which is have constant load, which the blade, washing machine, specially front loading, the load will vary depend on your cloth weight

so you need to control the power of your motor, to achieve a certain speed
this is actually easy, you can using TRIAC in this case
but how to control the trigger magically

after some reasearch 
i've found we need to know the thing called zero crossing
